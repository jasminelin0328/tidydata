# Overview
This codebook provides information about the data source, data, and transformations used the script run_analysis.R.
# Data Sources

Data source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Full description and more information: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

# Variables
More information about each variable can be found from the README.txt and features.txt files extracted from the data source.
These files will automatically be extracted when you run the script run_analysis.R

# Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sample d in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

# Record information
For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

# Files used
While more files are available in the data source, run_analysis.R only uses the below files:
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'subject_train.txt': Training subjects.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'subject_test.txt': Test subjects.

# Transformations
As required by the assigment the script run_analysis.R does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Changes the activity data from numbers into their descriptions e.g. "WALKING" instead of 1
4. Labels each variable (column) in the data set using features.txt (after changing names to lower case)
5. Creates a new data set with the average of each activity and each subject for every variable in the previous data set from step 4.
